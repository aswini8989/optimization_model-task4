## Problem
A factory produces Product A and Product B to maximize profit given limited materials and labor.

## Objective
Maximize: 20A + 30B  
Subject to:
- 2A + B ≤ 100 (Material)
- A + 3B ≤ 90 (Labor)

## Tools Used
- Python
- PuLP (Linear Programming Solver)

## Result
- Produce 30 units of Product A
- Produce 20 units of Product B
- Max Profit: ₹1200
